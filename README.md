# Titanic-Survivor-Prediction-Model
This is a machine learning model.
Hi there,
I'm a beginner learning Machine Learning (ML) and this is one of my ML practice projects. 
In this repository, I built a machine learning model to predict those who are likely to survive the RMS Titanic shipwreck (occured 15 April, 1912).
This model is built based on the classification model under Supervised Machine Learning because the model is trying to predict if a passanger will survive the shipwreck based on some collected data (check code to understand better).
Prerequisites to understand this project include;
Basic knowledge of Python
An understanding of data science
The whole process is broken down into 3 stages;
-Data Collection: here is the link to the dataset: 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNrbPshNvrNHiTe1o-Cp1gpJKY-chv5Z/view?usp=sharing'
-Data Preprocessing: using Numpy(for numerical operations), Panda(for data analysis), Seaborn(for data visualization and exploratory data analysis), and Matplotlib.pyplot ( for data visualization and graphical plotting).
-Model Building: I built the model initially with a logistic regression model, after which I fine- tune it using some hyperparameters.
I'm open to receiving review/feedback on this project.
Thank you!
